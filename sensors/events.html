                               In today's fast moving world, no one want their activities to be delayed. this demand of ours has led us to the era of Algorithms. An Algo is a methodical set of steps that can be used to make calculations, resolve problems and reach decisions.<p>
                              "An algorithm isn't a particular calculation, but the method followed when making the calculation"

                                Each character represents an electrical element. The behavior of the person corresponds to the element's characteristics.Using these as clues identify what each character is in electrical analogy.<br>
                                Character A: Doesn't think of the past. He thinks only of the future.<br>
                                Character B: Adopts and responds immediately to all situations.<br>
                                Character C: Doesn't like changes in life.<br>
                                Relate these clues to the elements' behavior and identify these characters. Then, connect these elements so that there is no current division between them on the given bread board. Now, identify across which element the LED will glow.<br>
                                This example is for a basic idea.

                        <br>3. Finding Space Complexity of Modified Algorithm
                        <p><b> EXAMPLE </b></p>
                        Given a sorted array arr[] of n elements, write a function to search a given element x in arr[].
                        <p>A simple approach is to do Linear Search. The time complexity of above algorithm is O(n). Another approach to perform the same task is using Binary Search.<p>
                        Binary Search: Search a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. Begin with an interval covering the whole array. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half. Otherwise narrow it to the upper half. Repeatedly check until the value is found, or the interval is empty.<p>
                        The idea of binary search is to use the information that the array is sorted and reduce the time complexity to O (logn).<p>
                        The example given here is a very basic model. But the problem that will be given will be more complex than this.

                        <br>-> The first round is basically a math quiz.
                        <br>-> Fixed number of questions will be given and participants are encouraged to answer the maximum.
                        <br>-> Based on the scores 6-8 teams will be shortlisted to the second round.
                        <p>ROUND 2:
                        <br>-> This round is more like dumb charades.
                        <br>-> Objects that can be mathematically described are given to one of the team members, he/she should use mathematical terms (the person is allowed to talk) and describe the object given to his team mates. And the team mates should guess the object correctly.
                        <br>-> For every team a total time of 90sec will be given . The one who explains is allowed to pick up any no. Of chart papers with object names.( Only after explanation of the taken one ).
                        <p> EXAMPLE:
                        <br> For example if mobile is given, the participant will use length and breadth for describing a rectangle. And then he can expand the dimension and end up with cuboid. So this is how one should describe the object and end up with the answer.

                          Build a manually controlled robot which is capable of racing on a rough circuit along with its fellow bots.<br>
                          In the shortest period of time, it must be able to complete the track specified.
                          <p><b>EVENT RULES:</b></p>

                          The participating teams will drive their robot individually in the track.<br>
                          The track may contain stable obstacles of small,medium and large sizes. The bot hitting the large obstacle will be given a penalty of +3 sec, hitting the medium size obstacle will get a penalty of +4 sec and the bot hitting the smaller obstacles will be given a penalty of +5 sec.
                          Each time the bot touches either one of the boundary, there will be a penalty of +2 seconds.
                          The time taken to complete the circuit will be taken as your qualifying time.<br>
                          The 3 teams that finish the race quickly will be declared as winners.<br>
                          In case of any tie ,another race will be conducted and the winner will be declared.

                          In case the robot moves out off the arena, the robot will be placed at the previous checkpoint.<br>
                          Touching the robot during the game will lead to negative points.<br>
                          Unfair game may lead to disqualification of the team.<br>
